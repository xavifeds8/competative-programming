Given an array arr[] denoting heights of N towers
and a positive integer K, you have to modify 
the height of each tower either by increasing or decreasing 
them by K only once. After modifying, height should be a non-negative integer. 
Find out what could be the possible minimum difference 
of the height of shortest and longest towers 
after you have modified each tower."""
